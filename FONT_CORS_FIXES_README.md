# Font Loading and CORS Fixes - Summary

## 🎯 Issues Fixed

### 1. Font Loading Failures ✅
**Problem**: Browser couldn't find Inter fonts at `/fonts/inter.woff2`
**Root Cause**: Font files were in assets but not properly configured for build output

**Solutions Applied**:
- ✅ Created `public/fonts/inter.css` with proper font-face declarations
- ✅ Copied essential Inter font files to `public/fonts/` directory:
  - Inter-Regular.woff2 (400 weight)
  - Inter-Medium.woff2 (500 weight) 
  - Inter-SemiBold.woff2 (600 weight)
  - Inter-Bold.woff2 (700 weight)
- ✅ Added `@import url('/fonts/inter.css');` to main style.css
- ✅ Fonts now load from `/fonts/` path correctly

### 2. CORS Errors ✅
**Problem**: Backend blocked requests from Vercel preview URLs
**Root Cause**: CORS configuration only allowed specific domains

**Solutions Applied**:
- ✅ Implemented dynamic CORS origin validation in `backend/index.js`
- ✅ Added support for Vercel preview URL patterns:
  - `https://care-flow-*.vercel.app`
  - `https://*-albert-vos-projects.vercel.app`
- ✅ Added logging to show which origins are allowed/blocked
- ✅ Maintained existing localhost and production domain support

### 3. Backend Frontend URL Detection ✅
**Problem**: OAuth redirects used localhost even in production
**Root Cause**: `process.env.FRONTEND_URL` fallback logic was too simplistic

**Solutions Applied**:
- ✅ Created `getFrontendUrl()` utility function in `oauth.js`
- ✅ Smart URL detection logic:
  1. Use `FRONTEND_URL` if valid HTTP URL
  2. Use production URL if `NODE_ENV=production`
  3. Fallback to localhost for development
- ✅ Applied to all frontend redirects in OAuth flow
- ✅ Added detailed logging for troubleshooting

## 🧪 Testing Results Expected

After deploying these fixes:

### Font Loading:
- ❌ Before: `download failed (font-family: "Inter")` errors
- ✅ After: Fonts load successfully from `/fonts/inter.css`

### CORS:
- ❌ Before: `Cross-Origin Request Blocked` errors
- ✅ After: API calls succeed from any Vercel deployment URL

### OAuth Redirects:
- ❌ Before: Redirects to localhost in production
- ✅ After: Redirects to correct frontend URL based on environment

## 🚀 Files Modified

### Frontend:
- `public/fonts/inter.css` - New font-face declarations
- `public/fonts/` - Added Inter font files (woff2 format)
- `src/styles/style.css` - Added font import

### Backend:
- `backend/index.js` - Enhanced CORS configuration
- `backend/routes/oauth.js` - Smart frontend URL detection

## 🔧 Deployment Notes

1. **Font files are now in public/** - They'll be served at `/fonts/` path
2. **CORS is now dynamic** - Automatically handles new Vercel preview URLs
3. **Backend logging added** - Check server logs to verify CORS and URL detection
4. **No environment variable changes needed** - Smart detection handles various scenarios

## 🎉 Benefits

- **Improved UX**: Fonts load properly, no fallback font flash
- **Better Development**: CORS works for all Vercel preview deployments
- **Production Ready**: Smart environment detection works across platforms
- **Maintainable**: Centralized URL detection logic with detailed logging
