# RAG Implementation Dependencies

## Required Dependencies

Add these dependencies to your package.json:

```bash
npm install @google/generative-ai @pinecone-database/pinecone
```

## Environment Variables

Add to your `.env.development` file (since you're using Vite):

```env
VITE_GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_api_key_here
VITE_PINECONE_API_KEY=your_pinecone_api_key_here
```

✅ **Pinecone API key has been added to your .env.development file**

## Getting API Keys

### Google API Key (for Gemini Pro and Embeddings)
1. Go to https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey
2. Click "Create API Key"
3. Copy the key and add to your .env file

### Pinecone API Key
1. Go to https://www.pinecone.io/
2. Sign up for a free account
3. Go to your dashboard and create a new project
4. Copy the API key from your project settings
5. Add to your .env file

## Usage Instructions

1. Install the dependencies
2. Add the environment variables
3. The RAG system will automatically:
   - Initialize on first load
   - Create embeddings for the knowledge base
   - Store vectors in Pinecone
   - Provide intelligent verification for each step

## Features Implemented

- ✅ Google text-embedding-004 for vector embeddings
- ✅ Pinecone for vector storage and retrieval
- ✅ Gemini Pro for intelligent assessment
- ✅ Context-aware step verification
- ✅ Real-time feedback with detailed analysis
- ✅ Performance scoring and recommendations
- ✅ Fallback system when RAG is unavailable
- ✅ Knowledge base with CNA standards and procedures

## Knowledge Base Content

The system includes comprehensive knowledge about:
- Hand hygiene procedures
- PPE donning/doffing
- Transfer and mobility assistance
- CNA assessment rubrics
- Safety protocols
- Common errors and corrections
- Professional standards

## Performance Features

- Intelligent scoring (0-100) based on multiple criteria
- Safety compliance analysis
- Timing analysis with efficiency scoring
- Technical accuracy assessment
- Personalized learning objectives
- Confidence scoring for AI assessments
- Detailed feedback with improvement suggestions

## Troubleshooting

If the RAG system fails to initialize:
1. Check your API keys are correctly set
2. Verify your Pinecone index is created
3. Check network connectivity
4. The system will gracefully fallback to standard verification
