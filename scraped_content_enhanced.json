[1] In the health care setting, good communication is the foundation to trusting relationships that improve client outcomes. It is the gateway to providing holistic care. Holistic care addresses a client’s physical, emotional, social, and spiritual needs. [2] The communication process involves a sender, the message, and a receiver. See Figure 1.1 [3] for an illustration of the communication process. There are many aspects of the communication process that can alter the delivery and interpretation of the message. These aspects relate to the language and experience of both the sender and receiver, referred to as semantics. People typically make reference to things they are familiar with, including landmarks, popular culture, and slang.

Nonverbal communication includes body language and facial expressions, tone of voice, and pace of the conversation. See Figure 1.2 [4] for an illustration of body language communicating a message. Nonverbal communication can have a tremendous impact on the communication experience and may be much more powerful than the verbal message itself. You may have previously learned that 80% of communication is nonverbal communication. The importance of nonverbal communication during conversation has been broken down further, estimating that 55% of communication is body language, 38% is tone of voice, and 7% is the actual words spoken",

Health care professionals assess receivers’ preferred methods of communication and individual characteristics that might influence communication and then adapt communication to meet the receivers’ needs. For example, nursing assistants adapt verbal instructions for adult patients with cognitive disabilities. Although the information provided might be similar to that provided to a patient without disabilities, the way the information is provided is adapted based on the patient’s developmental level. A nursing assistant may ask a cognitively intact person, “What do you want for lunch?” but adapt this information for someone with impaired cognitive function by offering a choice, such as “Do you want a sandwich or soup for lunch?” This adaptation allows the cognitively impaired patient to make a choice without being confused or overwhelmed by too many options",

In addition to using verbal and nonverbal communication, people communicate with others using one of three styles. A passive communicator puts the rights of others before their own. Passive communicators tend to be apologetic or sound tentative when they speak and often do not speak up if they feel as if they are being wronged. Aggressive communicators , on the other hand, come across as advocating for their own rights despite possibly violating the rights of others when communicating. They tend to communicate in a way that tells others their feelings don’t matter. Assertive communicators respect the rights of others while also standing up for their own ideas and rights when communicating. An assertive person is direct, but not insulting or offensive",

[7] Assertive communication refers to a way of conveying information that describes the facts and the sender’s feelings without disrespecting the receiver’s feelings. Assertive communication is different from aggressive communication because it uses “I” messages, such as “I feel…,” “I understand…,” or “Help me to understand…,” to address issues instead of using “you” messages that can cause the receiver to feel as though they are being verbally attacked. Using assertive communication is an effective way to solve problems with patients, coworkers, and health care team members. For example, instead of using aggressive communication to say to a coworker, “You always leave your patients’ rooms a mess! I dread following you on the next shift,” an assertive communicator would use “I” messages. The assertive communicator might say, “I feel frustrated spending the first part of my shift decluttering patients’ rooms",

There are many factors that can distort the message you are trying to communicate, resulting in your message not being perceived by the receiver in the way you intended. When communicating, it is important to seek feedback that your message is clearly understood.

For example, an active listening technique is to restate what the person said and verify our understanding is correct, such as, “I hear you saying you are hesitant to go to physical therapy because you are afraid of falling. Is that correct?” This feedback process is the main difference between passive listening and active listening. [6] Touch is a powerful way to professionally communicate caring and compassion if done respectfully while being aware of the patient’s cultural beliefs. NAs commonly use professional touch when assessing, expressing concern, or comforting patients. For example, simply holding a patient’s hand during a painful procedure can be very effective in providing comfort. See Figure 1.4 [7] for an image of a nurse using touch as a therapeutic technique when caring for a patient.

For example, they may intend to say, “I would like to go to the bathroom,” but instead the words, “Bathroom, Go,” are expressed.

It may be beneficial for family members or others involved to discuss concerns with the nurse or unit supervisor and possibly schedule a care conference with the health care team to resolve their concerns. In this instance, the aide should understand that any anger directed at them may be a result of the situation rather than a reflection of anything they have personally done. Conflicts among coworkers can also be addressed with assertive communication techniques. As discussed in the “Communication Styles” subsection, using assertive communication is the best approach to address workplace conflict and a respectful way to make one’s viewpoints known. Communication should start between the two parties that have the conflict before involving other staff. It is best to think about the situation and develop a potential solution before approaching the coworker",

A typical time frame is to wait one day to think logically about a conflict before addressing it, often referred to as the “24-hour Rule.” If you have discussed your concerns with the coworker and offered a potential solution without any resolution in the situation, it is appropriate to notify your supervisor for additional assistance at that time.

Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs was created in 1943 by American psychologist Abraham Maslow. Maslow’s theory is based on the ranking of the importance of human needs and the belief that human actions are based on motivation to meet these needs. See an illustration of Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs in Figure 1.5. [1] Maslow’s theory states that unless the basic needs in the lower levels of the hierarchy are met, humans cannot experience the higher levels of psychological and self-fulfillment needs. The levels of Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs have the following definitions [2] : Maslow theorized that one cannot attain a higher level in any of these categories if the levels below are not met. For example, one is not motivated by a sense of belonging if they are focused on obtaining basic needs such as food, water, and shelter",

Belongingness to one person may mean being a part of a community group whereas to another it may mean having one very close friend. Self-esteem and feelings of accomplishment may be defined by one person as successfully graduating from high school, whereas to another it is defined by being able to run a mile without stopping.

[3] Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs is a good basis for providing holistic care and communicating with clients based on their needs and preferences. For example, in nursing, priorities of care are based on physiological needs and safety.

It theorizes there are eight stages of development based on a person’s chronological age. Development occurs based on the main conflict or challenge confronted during that period of time. Each stage can create either a virtue/strength or a maladaptive tendency. Erikson proposed that those who have a stronger sense of identity from resolving these conflicts over time have fewer conflicts within themselves and with others and, subsequently, a decreased level of anxiety",

Trust is the basis of our development during infancy (birth to 12 months). Infants are dependent on their caregivers, so caregivers who are responsive and sensitive to their infant’s needs help their baby to develop a sense of trust; their baby will see the world as a safe, predictable place. Unresponsive caregivers who do not meet their baby’s needs can engender feelings of anxiety, fear, and mistrust; their baby may see the world as unpredictable.

They begin to show clear preferences for certain elements of the environment, such as food, toys, and clothing. A toddler’s main task is to resolve the issue of autonomy versus shame and doubt by working to establish independence. For example, we might observe a budding sense of autonomy in a two-year-old child who wants to choose her clothes and dress herself. Although her outfits might not be appropriate for the situation, her input in such basic decisions has an effect on her sense of independence. If denied the opportunity to act on her environment, she may begin to doubt her abilities, which could lead to low self-esteem and feelings of shame.

When clients experience a serious illness or injury, they often grapple with the existential question, “Why is this happening to me?” This question can be a sign of spiritual distress defined as, “A state of suffering related to the inability to experience meaning in life through connections with self, others, the world, or a superior being.” Spiritual well-being is a pattern of experiencing meaning and purpose in life through connectedness with self, others, art, music, literature, nature, and/or a power greater than oneself. Spirituality is often mistakenly equated with religion, but spirituality is a broader concept. Elements of spirituality include faith, meaning, love, belonging, forgiveness, and connectedness. [15] Spirituality and religion can change over a person’s lifetime and vary greatly between people. Some people who are very spiritual may not belong to a specific religion. Religion is frequently defined as an institutionalized set of beliefs and practices",

In these settings, chaplains support and encourage people of all religious faiths and cultures and customize their approach to each individual’s background, age, and medical condition.

[16] NAs may suggest chaplain services for their clients. An important way to assist a client with their spiritual well-being is to ask them what they need to feel supported in their faith and then try to accommodate their requests, if possible. Explain that spiritual health helps the healing process.

When providing an oral report, be mindful of confidentiality and where the report is given so no one overhears private information.

Common situations requiring immediate emergency response include heart attacks (myocardial infarctions), strokes (cerebrovascular accidents), seizures, falls, fires, and choking. Myocardial infarction (MI) is the medical term for what is commonly referred to as a “heart attack.” It is caused by a lack of blood flow and oxygen to a region of the heart, resulting in the death of cardiac muscle cells. An MI is typically caused by a blocked coronary artery that occurs when the buildup of plaque creates a clot or when a piece of the plaque breaks off and travels to a smaller vessel, creating a blockage. When the cardiac muscle cells are starved of oxygen and begin to die during an MI, there is typically a sudden onset of severe pain called angina beneath the sternum. This pain often radiates down the left arm or into the jaw",

Strokes can also be caused by a blood vessel in the brain rupturing and bleeding, called a hemorrhagic stroke. Risk factors for strokes include smoking, high blood pressure, and cardiac arrhythmias (i.e., irregularities in heart rate and/or rhythm). Lack of blood flow to the brain for more than a few minutes causes irreversible brain damage. The longer a person goes without treatment for a stroke, the more damage that occurs to their brain cells. Damaged brain cells can result in paralysis, cognitive impairment, difficulty speaking and understanding words, and mood swings. For this reason, it is important to recognize early signs of a stroke and obtain rapid emergency treatment. The treatment for a stroke depends on the cause.

Strokes caused by a blockage are treated with thrombolytic medication (such as tPA) to dissolve the clot. See Figure 3.2 [4] for an image of a stroke caused by a blockage. Hemorrhagic strokes occur due to a ruptured vessel in the brain. These types of strokes often require surgery to stop the bleeding. Stroke treatments work best if the symptoms of a stroke are recognized early and emergency treatment occurs within three hours of the onset of symptoms. [5] Strokes typically affect one side of the brain based on where the blood flow was disrupted. Because of the brain’s anatomy, the symptoms of a stroke occur on the opposite side of the body as the affected side of the brain. For example, if a stroke occurs in the left side of the brain, the right side of the body will be affected, resulting in signs and symptoms occurring only on the right side of the body",

If blood flow is interrupted, even for just a few seconds, a transient ischemic attack (TIA) , also called ministroke, may occur.

After they are on the floor, protect their head from directly hitting the floor by placing a pillow or your leg underneath their head. During the seizure, the person may bite their tongue or gag. However, do not place anything in their mouth because this will increase the risk of choking. Immediately notify the nurse if you observe the start of a seizure and note the time it started. When the seizure has ended, carefully assist the person into bed. Due to the trauma experienced during the seizure, it is typical for the person to sleep for several hours. Some individuals with seizure disorders may also receive antianxiety medication to prevent another seizure from occurring.

In the United States, about a third of older adults who live at home and about half of people living in nursing homes fall at least once a year. There are many factors that increase the risk of falling in older adults. These risk factors include mobility problems, balance disorders, chronic illnesses, and impaired vision. Many falls cause injury, ranging from mild bruising to broken bones, head injuries, and even death. In fact, falls are a leading cause of death in older adults. If you enter a room and discover a resident has fallen, do not move them unless they are in immediate danger of further injury",

The ABC mnemonic for using proper body mechanics when transferring or repositioning residents stands for A lignment, B ase of support, and C enter of gravity [3] : For example, when lifting objects or people, keep your center of gravity low with a good base of support by bending at the knees with the feet shoulder width apart. Keep in mind that your center of gravity also includes the resident or the object, so keep them as close to your body as possible. To maintain good alignment, face the person or object you are moving and use both sides of your body equally. Figure 3.7 [4] illustrates safer body mechanics in Option “C” by maintaining good alignment, establishing a base of support, and keeping the load close and near to one’s center of gravity while bending the knees",

An infection that develops in an individual after being admitted to a health care facility or undergoing a medical procedure is a healthcare-associated infection (HAI) , formerly referred to as a nosocomial infection. About 1 in 31 hospital patients develops at least one healthcare-associated infection every day. HAIs increase the cost of care and delay recovery. They are associated with permanent disability, loss of wages, and even death. An example of an HAI is a skin infection that develops in a patient’s incision after they had surgery due to improper hand hygiene of health care workers. [3] , [4] It is important to understand the dangers of Healthcare-Acquired Infections and actions that can be taken to prevent them.

Physical defenses are the body’s most basic form of defenses against infection. Physical defenses include barriers such as skin and mucous membranes, as well as mechanical defenses, that physically remove microbes from areas of the body. [1] One of the body’s most important physical barriers is the skin barrier that is composed of three layers of closely packed cells. See Figure 4.2 [2] for an illustration of layers of the skin. The topmost layer of skin, called the epidermis, consists of cells that are packed with keratin. Keratin makes the skin’s surface mechanically tough and resists degradation by bacteria",

When the skin barrier becomes broken, such as becoming cracked from dryness, microorganisms can enter and cause infection. [3] Mucous membranes lining the nose, mouth, lungs, and urinary and digestive tracts provide another nonspecific barrier against pathogens. Mucous is a moist, sticky substance that covers and protects the layers beneath it and also traps debris, including microbes. Mucus secretions also contain antimicrobial agents. [4] In many regions of the body, mechanical actions flush mucus (along with trapped microbes) out of the body or away from potential sites of infection. For example, in the respiratory system, inhalation can bring microbes, dust, mold spores, and other small airborne debris into the body. This debris becomes trapped in the mucus lining the respiratory tract. The cells lining the upper parts of the respiratory tract have hair-like appendages known as cilia",

The expelled mucus is then swallowed (and destroyed in the stomach) or coughed out. However, smoking limits the efficiency of this system, making smokers more susceptible to developing respiratory infections. Additionally, as people age, their chest muscles weaken, and coughing becomes less productive, which also increases the risk of developing a respiratory infection. In addition to physical barriers, the body has several mechanical defenses that physically remove pathogens from the body and prevent infection. For example, the flushing action of urine carries microbes away from the body and is responsible for maintaining a sterile environment of the urinary tract. The eyes have additional physical barriers and mechanical mechanisms for preventing infections",

Eyelashes and eyelids are physical barriers that prevent dust and airborne microorganisms from reaching the surface of the eye. Any microbes or debris that make it past these physical barriers are flushed out by the mechanical action of blinking. Blinking bathes the eye in tears and washes debris away. [5] See Figure 4.3 [6] for an example of eyelashes as a mechanical defense. In addition to physical and mechanical defenses, our immune system uses several chemical defenses that inhibit microbial invaders. The term chemical mediators refers to a wide array of substances found in various fluids and tissues throughout the body.

Sebum provides an additional layer of defense by helping seal off the pore of the hair follicle and preventing bacteria on the skin’s surface from invading sweat glands and surrounding tissue. However, environmental factors can affect these chemical defenses of the skin. For example, low humidity in the winter dries the skin and makes it more susceptible to pathogens that are normally inhibited by the skin’s low pH. Application of skin moisturizer restores moisture and essential oils to the skin and helps prevent dry skin from becoming infected.

[18] Additional hygiene measures are also used to prevent the spread of infection. For example, regularly changing bed linens, towels, and hospital gowns eliminates potential reservoirs of bacteria. Gripper socks should be removed before patients get into bed to prevent pathogens from the floor from being transferred to the patient’s bed linens. Mobile devices should be cleaned regularly.

Patients, staff, and visitors routinely bring mobile devices into health care facilities that can cause the spread of infection. Mobile devices should be frequently wiped with disinfectant. Disinfection and sterilization are procedures used to remove harmful pathogens from equipment and the environment to decrease the risk of spreading infection. Disinfection is the removal of microorganisms, but it does not destroy all spores and viruses. Sterilization destroys all pathogens on equipment or in the environment, including spores and viruses, and includes methods such as steam, boiling water, dry heat, radiation, and chemicals. Because of the harshness of sterilization methods, skin can only be disinfected and not sterilized. [19] Asepsis refers to the absence of infectious material or infection",

Surgical asepsis is the absence of all microorganisms during any type of invasive procedure, such as during surgery or heart catheterizations. Sterilization is performed on equipment used during invasive procedures. As a nursing assistant, you may assist a registered nurse during a procedure requiring sterile technique; however, performing sterile procedures independently is not in the scope of practice for nursing assistants. In long-term care and other health care settings other than surgery, medical asepsis is used. Medical asepsis refers to techniques used to prevent the transfer of microorganisms from one person or object to another but do not eliminate all microorganisms. Nursing assistants implement medical asepsis in the following ways: When handling dirty linens, textiles, and patients’ clothing, follow agency policy regarding transport to prevent the potential spread of infection",

Transmission-based precautions (commonly referred to as isolation precautions) use specific types of personal protective equipment (PPE) and practices based on the pathogen’s mode of transmission. It is vital for nursing assistants to understand what PPE should be used in specific client care situations, which is determined by the pathogen’s mode of transmission and their possible risk of exposure.

In long-term care settings, masks are typically secured by elastic loops around the ears. The top edge of the mask has a bendable strip to secure the seal of the mask over the bridge of the nose. Some situations require masks to be combined with a face shield or a visor that covers the eyes. See Figure 4.11 [12] for an image of masks used with eyeglasses and an eyeshield. Medical masks should be worn when providing care that may cause splashing or spraying of blood or body fluids or within six feet of a client who is coughing or has been placed in droplet precautions.

Single-use disposable medical masks are effective when providing care to most clients and should be changed when damp or soiled. When medical masks become moist, they may not provide an effective barrier to microorganisms. A medical mask, when properly worn, should fit snugly over the nose, mouth, and under the chin so that microorganisms and body fluids cannot enter or exit through the sides of the mask. If the health care worker wears glasses, the glasses should be placed over the top edge of the mask. This will help prevent the glasses from becoming foggy as the person wearing the mask exhales.

See Figure 4.13 [14] for CDC recommendations when wearing disposable respirators. A newer piece of equipment used for respiratory protection is the powered air-purifying respirator (PAPR). A PAPR is an air-purifying respirator that uses a blower to force air through filter cartridges or canisters into the breathing zone of the wearer. This process creates an air flow inside either a tight-fitting facepiece or loose-fitting hood or helmet, providing a higher level of protection against aerosolized pathogens, such as COVID-19, during respiratory suctioning.

There are a lot of things to consider when preventing the spread of infection among residents, staff, equipment, and surfaces. It is important to think about the tasks you will be performing for residents and determine ahead of time what you might be exposed to in order to select the appropriate PPE. The perspective and needs of clients placed in isolation precautions should also be considered. PPE makes communication more difficult by hiding facial expressions and making hearing more difficult, and therapeutic touch is less personal when wearing gloves. Caregivers often spend less time interacting with clients in transmission-based precautions due to the labor intensiveness of putting on and taking off PPE, resulting in clients often developing feelings of loneliness and social isolation due to less frequent interactions.

A fever is a common sign of inflammation and infection. A temperature of 38 degrees Celsius (100.4 degrees F) is generally considered a low-grade fever, and a temperature of 38.3 degrees Celsius (101 degrees F) is considered a fever. Fever is part of the body’s nonspecific immune response and can be beneficial in destroying pathogens.

It also includes asking each person how they would like to be addressed, as well as avoiding demeaning terms like “honey,” “sweetie,” or “sweetheart.” Promote their dignity by using age-appropriate words and avoiding words like “diaper,” “bib,” “potty,” or “feeders.” The vital element of person-centered care is effective communication between the health care provider, the client, and the client’s family members or significant others. Effective communication facilitates information sharing and trust.

Examples of using the person-centered care approach are knowing the time the resident prefers to wake up and go to bed; their preference for showers, tubs, or bed baths; their preferred arrangement of their belongings; and their mobility issues. Cares are individualized based on these preferences. Respecting residents’ dignity and privacy is demonstrated by keeping them covered and warm when bathing, explaining procedures prior to doing them, and protecting their health information. It also means respecting personal beliefs, being aware of cultural differences, and offering choices and options when available. It is important to remember that it is often difficult for clients to feel dependent on others to provide their personal care",

Allow them to make decisions about their care and encourage them to perform as much self-care as possible to promote their independence, self-esteem, and sense of control over their care. An added physical benefit of encouraging residents to perform self-care is it maintains their strength and mobility, thereby preventing a decline in physical function for as long as possible.",

The dermis contains hair follicles (the roots of hair shafts), sebaceous oil glands, blood vessels, endocrine sweat glands, and nerve endings. The bottommost layer of skin is the hypodermis (also referred to as the subcutaneous layer). It mostly consists of adipose tissue (fat), along with some blood vessels and nerve endings. Beneath the hypodermis layer lie bone, muscle, ligaments, and tendons. [2] As discussed in Chapter 4 , the skin is the body’s first layer of defense against pathogens entering the body.

Nursing assistants provide the vast majority of bathing and are able to observe and report any changes to skin integrity while performing ADLs on a daily basis. Impaired skin integrity refers to skin that is damaged or not healing normally. An example of impaired skin integrity is a pressure injury (also called a bedsore or pressure ulcer) with damage to the skin and surrounding tissue. See Figure 5.3 [3] for an image of a pressure injury on a client’s lower back above their buttocks. Several changes occur in the skin as one ages. As people age, the amount of adipose tissue decreases. Adipose tissue (i.e., body fat) provides insulation to keep one warm, as well as protection against injury by cushioning underlying structures. See Figure 5.4 [4] for an image of age-related changes in the skin on the hand of an older adult. Oil glands are less productive, making skin drier and more susceptible to cracking",

Dry skin and cracked skin make older adults more susceptible to injuries, like skin tears and pressure injuries, that create openings for pathogens and increase the risk of infection. NAs can encourage good nutrition and hydration to help maintain good skin integrity. Older residents also have reduced production of sweat, which affects the ability of their body to regulate their temperature. This makes them more susceptible to heat-related illness such as exhaustion and heat stroke, especially when being physically active in the heat. [5] Due to less oil and sweat production as one ages, daily showering or full body bathing is not necessary and can even be damaging to skin.

It is important to adequately dry skin folds and moisturize the skin regularly to maintain skin integrity and prevent dryness, cracking, and infection. Additionally, clients who are immobile should be repositioned at least every two hours to reduce the risk of pressure injuries. Repositioning techniques can be found in Chapter 8 . Skin needs oxygen and nutrients carried in blood to stay healthy. Any condition that impairs blood flow will increase the risk of skin conditions. As a person ages, a general decline in cardiac function decreases blood flow and oxygen to the skin, putting all older adults at increased risk for skin breakdown. Common medical disorders affecting skin health include high cholesterol that causes blockages of blood flow in the arteries, heart failure, high blood pressure, and diabetes",

Recognize how the presentation of the food and the table influence one’s appetite. Consider with whom you like to share your meal. All these factors should be considered when feeding a resident. Avoid using feeding techniques that are used with young children, such as making noises, moving utensils like airplanes, etc. Residents should be offered a clothing protector to avoid soiling their clothes or gown, but to maintain their dignity, these protectors should never be referred to as a “bib.” When the meal is ready to consume, describe to the resident what they have on their tray to eat and drink",

For example, the nursing assistant can state, “Your mashed potatoes are at 10 o’clock, the green beans are at 2 o’clock, and the meat loaf is at 6 o’clock on your plate.” If a resident has an order for a pureed diet (i.e., all food is blended to smooth consistency), know what each food is and name it when assisting the resident. Nutritional requirements for each resident are determined by the dietary staff. Each resident has a specific type of diet ordered, including texture and consistency of liquids. It is imperative for nursing assistants to check the resident’s care plan to know what type of diet is currently ordered and be familiar with the appearance of these types of diets.

Please see 5.25 Skills Checklist for additional information. A urostomy is placed surgically to collect urine from the ureters when the bladder is diseased or has been removed. Urostomies are typically located on the lower right side of the abdomen, and urine is collected into a drainage bag. See Figure 5.20 [4] for an illustration of a urostomy. A colostomy is placed surgically when colon function is impaired. A piece of the colon is diverted to an artificial opening in the abdominal wall called a stoma, and feces is collected in a pouch.

Maintain awareness of a resident who is toileting or on the bedpan so they do not need to wait for assistance with perineal care after elimination and will not develop any skin issues from sitting on a hard surface. To maintain dignity, nurse aides should be careful when explaining and providing care related to toileting. For example, a disposable brief should never be referred to as a diaper; acceptable terms include a brief, pad, liner, or disposable underwear. Additionally, a nurse aide should never show reluctance or appear burdened when providing toileting assistance, no matter how often a resident feels the need to be toileted or requires perineal care due to incontinence",

Incontinence is a very personal matter and can be embarrassing for clients. Nursing assistants should use therapeutic communication when assisting clients with toileting. When indicated, clients may undergo bladder and bowel retraining to regain control of elimination. There are several strategies used to promote bladder continence. The nurse aide may assist the nurse with one of the strategies called timed voiding. Timed voiding encourages the patient to urinate on a set schedule, such as every hour, whether they feel the urge to urinate or not. The time between bathroom trips is gradually extended with the general goal of achieving four hours between voiding. Timed voiding helps to control urge and overflow incontinence as the brain is trained to be less sensitive to the sensation of the bladder walls expanding as they fill",

This training includes encouraging clients to go to the bathroom when feeling the urge to do so and not ignoring the urge. For some individuals, it is helpful to schedule this consistent time in the morning when the natural urge occurs after drinking warm fluids or eating breakfast. For other people, especially those with a neurological cause, a laxative may be scheduled regularly to stimulate the urge to have a bowel movement on a regular basis and prevent constipation. The nurse should communicate to the nursing assistant when bowel retraining is in place, or a laxative is administered to a client so they are aware of the client’s need to defecate.

Kidney infections are more serious than a bladder infection because they can have long-lasting effects on the kidneys. Some people are at higher risk of getting a UTI. UTIs are more common in females because their urethras are shorter and closer to the rectum, which makes it easier for bacteria to enter the urinary tract. Providing improper perineal care is a common cause of a UTI. Nursing assistants must be diligent and assist with perineal hygiene as needed to prevent infections. Other factors that can increase the risk of UTIs include the following: Symptoms of a UTI should be reported to the nurse immediately and include the following: Symptoms of a more serious kidney infection (called pyelonephritis) include fever above 101 degrees F (38.3 degrees C), shaking chills, lower back pain or flank pain (i.e., on the sides of the back), and nausea or vomiting",

Let’s begin by reviewing the anatomy and physiology of the gastrointestinal system. The gastrointestinal system (also referred to as the digestive system) is responsible for several functions, including digestion, absorption, and immune response. Digestion begins at the mouth, where chewing of food occurs. This is called mechanical digestion. If food is not broken down mechanically by the teeth, it is very difficult to digest, and it also increases the risk of choking. If there are any concerns with missing or broken teeth, dentures that don’t fit well, or any pain or open areas in the mouth, the NA should report these concerns to the nurse immediately. After food is chewed and swallowed, it goes into the stomach via the esophagus. Involuntary movement, called peristalsis, allows the food to enter the stomach to mix with acidic gastric juices",

The breaking down of food with these acids is called chemical digestion. From the stomach, the liquid food (called chyme) passes through the small and large intestine where nutrients and water are absorbed into the bloodstream. Waste products are condensed into feces and excreted through the anus. [1] , [2] More information on the structure and function of the digestive system will be covered in Chapter 11 . Appropriate food and fluid intake are essential to good health, so anything that potentially decreases a client’s appetite must be addressed.

Conversely, too few macronutrients contribute to nutrient deficiencies and malnourishment. [3] Carbohydrates are sugars and starches and are an important energy source. Each gram of carbohydrates provides four calories. Carbohydrates break down into glucose and raise blood sugar levels. Diabetics should limit carbohydrate intake to maintain blood sugar levels in a healthy range. Proteins are peptides and amino acids that provide four calories per gram.

Due to its high-calorie content, a little fat goes a long way. [4] Fats are classified as saturated, unsaturated, and trans fatty acids. Saturated fats come from animal products, such as butter and red meat (e.g., steak). Saturated fats are solid at room temperature. Recommended intake of saturated fats is less than 10% of daily calories because saturated fat raises cholesterol and contributes to heart disease.

Fats containing omega-3 fatty acids are considered polyunsaturated fats and help lower cholesterol levels. Fish and other seafood are excellent sources of omega-3 fatty acids. [6] Trans fats are fats that have been altered through a hydrogenation process, so they are not in their natural state. During the hydrogenation process, fat is changed to make it harder at room temperature and have a longer shelf life. Trans fats are found in processed foods, such as chips, crackers, and cookies, as well as in some margarines and salad dressings. Minimal trans-fat intake is recommended because it increases cholesterol and contributes to heart disease. [7] Good resources for healthy nutritional choices are the USDA’s “My Plate” guidelines",

Dairy choices are important for calcium intake that aids in bone health. Calcium intake is important for older adults because they naturally retain less calcium and are at higher risk for bone fractures. Dairy products include milk, lactose-free milk, soy milk, buttermilk, cheese, yogurt, and kefir. Sour cream and cream cheese are not considered dairy items in terms of nutritional benefits. Adults should consume about three cups of dairy per day. Choosing whole foods that are unprocessed, or as close to their original form as possible, is important to feeling full and stabilizing blood sugar because it takes longer to digest unprocessed foods. Think about eating an apple as compared to drinking apple juice. The whole apple will take a long time to chew and chemically break down to chyme, whereas the juice is ready to move through the digestive tract immediately",

For example, most fruits and vegetables contain a lot of water, so they contribute to fluid intake. See Table 6.2 [10] for water content in various foods. Table 6.2 Water Content in Foods The average fluid intake in adults per day is 1.5 liters of fluids with additional 700 milliliters (mL) of water gained from solid foods. About 2.5 liters of fluid are excreted daily in adults in urine, feces, respiration, and other body fluids like sweat and saliva.

Additionally, the amount of fluids a person consumes daily is variable and based on their climate, age, physical activity level, and kidney function. [12] Our bodies are constantly trying to balance our fluid volume using the physiological mechanisms of thirst and urine output. The “thirst center” is contained within the hypothalamus, a portion of the brain that lies just above the brain stem. As people age, their thirst mechanism becomes less responsive, causing a higher risk of dehydration. See Figure 6.2 [13] for an illustration of the thirst response. Thirst occurs in the following sequence of physiological events: Thirst is a subconscious physiological mechanism to stimulate water intake.

Conversely, older adults often have decreased fluid intake due to physical or cognitive challenges in obtaining or drinking fluids. For this reason, older adults often require assistance to maintain a healthy intake of fluids. Due to the decreased thirst response in older adults, it is important to prevent dehydration by encouraging fluid intake even when they don’t feel thirsty. Dehydration can lead to confusion, falls, and bladder infections.

Some people suffer chronic pain even when there is no past injury or apparent body damage, and it may not be located in a specific area of the body. [8] People experiencing chronic pain often have other physical effects that are stressful on the body such as tense muscles, limited ability to move around, lack of energy, and appetite or sleep changes. Emotional effects of chronic pain include depression, anger, anxiety, and fear of reinjury. These effects can limit a person’s ability to return to their regular work or leisure activities.

Subjective signs of pain are what the person reports to you, such as “My stomach hurts” or “My knees ache when I walk.” Objective data is observable, such as the change in vital signs that can occur when an individual is experiencing acute pain. Signs of pain can also include nonverbal responses such as grimacing, guarding the injured body part, rocking, rubbing the area, or moaning. See Figure 6.8 [11] for an image of observable signs of pain. When an individual is unable to communicate pain due to cognitive deficits, recognizing objective signs of pain is vital for providing comfort measures and improving their quality of life. The Pain Assessment in Advanced Dementia (PAINAD) is an example of a tool that nurses and NAs use to identify the presence of pain in individuals who are unable to verbally report it",

Despite any conflicts in decision-making among health care providers, family members, and the patient, the team must always advocate for the patient’s wishes. If a nursing assistant notices conflicts or is questioned by the client or family members, they should notify the nurse. Nurses have practice guidelines for ethical dilemmas in the American Nurses Association’s Standards of Professional Nursing Practice and Code of Ethics. These resources assist the nurse in implementing expected behaviors according to their professional role as a nurse. [4] If complex ethical dilemmas occur, many organizations have dedicated ethics committees that offer support, guidance, and resources for complex ethical decisions. These committees can serve as support systems, share resources, provide legal insight, and make recommendations for action",

[5] Additional legal considerations when providing care at the end of life are do-not-resuscitate (DNR) orders and advance directives. A Do-Not-Resuscitate (DNR) order is a medical order that instructs health care professionals to not perform cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) if a patient’s breathing stops or their heart stops beating. CPR is emergency treatment provided when a patient’s blood flow or breathing stops and may involve chest compressions and mouth-to-mouth breathing, electric shocks to restart the heart, breathing tubes to open the airway, or cardiac medications",

Wallet cards, bracelets, or other DNR documents are also available for individuals to have at home or in nonhospital settings. The decision to implement a DNR order is typically very difficult for a patient and their family members to make. Many people have unrealistic ideas regarding the success rates of CPR and the quality of life a patient experiences after being revived, especially for patients with multiple chronic diseases.

Cheyne-Stokes respirations can be observed as gaps in breathing of several seconds, and long and labored or quick and shallow inhalation and exhalation. There may be gurgling or rattling of the lungs when breathing. Intake will decrease and eventually stop altogether, and output will follow the same pattern.

There is no one correct way to grieve, and an individual’s specific needs and feelings must remain central to care planning. [11] Kuber-Ross identified that patients and families demonstrate various characteristic responses to grief and loss. These stages include denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance, commonly referred to by the mnemonic “DABDA.” See Figure 6.10 [12] for an illustration of the Kubler-Ross Grief Cycle. Keep in mind that these stages of grief not only occur due to loss of life, but also due to significant life changes such as divorce, loss of friendships, loss of a job, or diagnosis with a chronic or terminal illness",

This stage is characterized by an individual stating, “This can’t be happening.” The feeling of denial is self-protective as an individual attempts to numb overwhelming emotions as they process the information. The denial process can help to offset the immediate shock of a loss. Denial is commonly experienced during traumatic or sudden loss or if unexpected life-changing information or events occur. For example, a patient who presents to the physician for a severe headache and receives a diagnosis of terminal brain cancer may experience feelings of denial and disregard the diagnosis altogether. See Figure 6.11 [14] for an image of a person reacting to unexpected news with denial. Anger in the grief process often masks pain and sadness.

If possible, the nursing assistant can provide supportive presence and allow the patient or family member time to vent their anger and frustration while still maintaining boundaries for respectful discussion. Rather than focusing on what to say or not to say, allowing a safe place for a patient or family member to verbalize their frustration, sorrow, and anger can offer great support. See Figure 6.12 [15] for an image of a patient experiencing anger. Bargaining can occur during the grief process in an attempt to regain control of the loss. When individuals enter this phase, they are looking to find ways to change or negotiate the outcome by making a deal. Some may try to make a deal with God or their higher power to take away their pain or to change their reality by making promises to do better or give more of themselves if only the circumstances were different",

Depression can cause loss of interest in activities, people, or relationships that previously brought one satisfaction. There is no pleasure or joy surrounding anything. Additionally, individuals experiencing depression may experience irritability, sleeplessness, and loss of focus. It is not uncommon for individuals in the depression phase to experience significant fatigue and loss of energy. Simple tasks such as getting out of bed, taking a shower, or preparing a meal can feel so overwhelming that individuals simply withdraw from activity",

Depression can be associated with ineffective coping behaviors, and nursing assistants should watch for signs of self-medicating through the use of alcohol or drugs to mask or numb depressive feelings. Any remarks made about feeling depressed or talk of self-harm should be reported immediately. Other symptoms to report include noticed changes in behavior such as isolation or withdrawal from activity, sleeping more or less, and decreased interest in hygiene and self-care. Further discussion about depression can be found in Chapter 10 . See Figure 6.13 [16] for an image of an individual demonstrating feelings of depression.

Documentation is used to ensure continuity of care across shifts and among health care team members, to monitor standards of care for quality assurance activities, and to provide information for reimbursement purposes by insurance companies and Medicare or Medicaid. Documentation may also be used for research purposes or, in some instances, for legal concerns in a court of law. [1] For these reasons, always document the care you provide and never document for someone else. Review Chapter 1, “ Documenting and Reporting ” for details on how observations should be recorded. The facility or employer should provide training on how to document according to their expectations and what should be included in the client’s record",

CBE may include checklists and flowsheets as efficient means of documenting that standards of care have been provided. For example, nursing assistants may document activities of daily living (ADL) or vital signs on a flow sheet. See an example of an ADL flowsheet using the information in the following box. Keep in mind that documentation is reviewed and submitted by agencies for insurance reimbursement, so it is imperative that charting is accurate and up-to-date.

Nursing assistants use critical thinking skills to determine what should be immediately reported to the nurse. If you are unsure about the significance of a finding, it is best to report it to the nurse and allow them to determine what is needed for the resident.

Subjective signs of discomfort are what the person reports to you such as, “My stomach hurts,” or “I feel achy when I walk.” Subjective reports cannot be verified objectively and must be reported based on what the person communicates. For this reason, when documenting subjective data, write exactly what the client said in quotations. For example, a nursing assistant might document: The client stated, “My stomach hurts.” Objective data are observable and verifiable. Nursing assistants may suspect a client is experiencing discomfort based on nonverbal signs, such as grimacing, guarding the injured body part, rocking, rubbing the area, or moaning. When a client is unable to verbally communicate, noticing objective signs of pain is integral for providing comfort measures and improving their quality of life",

[2] Accurate temperature measurements provide information about a patient’s health status and guide clinical decisions made by the nurse. For example, an elevated temperature (referred to as a fever) can indicate the client is experiencing an infection. Body temperature is documented in degrees Celsius (ºC) or Fahrenheit (ºF).

For example, if the patient recently consumed a hot or cold food or beverage, chewed gum, or smoked prior to measurement, a falsely elevated or decreased reading may be obtained. Oral temperature should be taken 15 to 25 minutes following consumption of a hot or cold beverage or food or 5 minutes after chewing gum or smoking. [4] Axillary temperature is taken in the armpit.

If the patient is lying down, this may lower their heart rate so their position should be documented. Pulse is measured in beats per minute. The normal adult pulse rate (heart rate) at rest is 60–100 beats per minute, with different ranges according to age. [14] See normal pulse ranges by age in Table 7.5b in the “ Normal Ranges for Vital Signs ” section of this chapter. The pulse rate should be regular, meaning the frequency of the pulsation felt by your fingers is an even tempo with equal intervals between pulsations.

It is considered best practice to assess a patient’s pulse for a full 60 seconds, especially if there is an irregularity to the rhythm. [15] Respiration refers to a person’s breathing and the movement of air into and out of the lungs. Inspiration refers to the process causing air to enter the lungs, and expiration refers to the process causing air to leave the lungs. A respiratory cycle (i.e., measured as one breath for the respiratory rate) is one sequence of inspiration and expiration (i.e., the chest rises and falls once). [16] The quality of a person’s breathing is normally relaxed and silent. However, loud breathing, nasal flaring, or the use of accessory muscles in the neck, chest, or ribs is a sign of breathing problems (referred to as respiratory distress )",

People who are experiencing respiratory distress naturally assume a tripod position , meaning they lean forward and place their arms or elbows on their knees or on a bedside table to help improve lung expansion. If a patient is demonstrating new signs of respiratory distress as you are obtaining their vital signs, immediately notify the nurse. [17] Respirations normally have a regular rhythm in children and adults who are awake. A regular rhythm means that the frequency of the respiration follows an even tempo with equal intervals between each respiration. However, newborns and infants commonly exhibit an irregular respiratory rhythm. [18] Normal respiratory rates vary based on age. The normal resting respiratory rate for adults is 12–20 breaths per minute, whereas infants younger than one year old normally have a respiratory rate of 30–60 breaths per minute. [19] See normal respiratory rate ranges by age in Table 7.5c in the “ Normal Ranges for Vital Signs ” section of this chapter",

When obtaining a respiratory rate, the most accurate measurement is obtained when the client is not aware you are watching their breathing; knowing they are being observed can unconsciously change their breathing pattern. For this reason, many nursing assistants count the client’s respirations while they appear to be taking their pulse. (This is one exception to the standard rule of explaining to the client what you will be doing.) When counting respirations, it can be difficult to see a complete respiratory cycle. Respirations can be observed by looking at the client’s shoulders move up and down with each breath, the stomach or chest rising and falling, or the clothing around the ribs moving. You may have to ask the client to remain quiet while respirations are being observed because talking or moving changes the respiratory rate",

Respirations are documented as the number of breaths per minute, with each cycle of inspiration and exhalation counting as one breath. Blood pressure is the measurement of the force of blood against the walls of the arteries as the heart pumps blood through the body. It is reported as millimeters of mercury (mmHg). This pressure inside the arteries changes when the heart is contracting compared to when the heart is resting and filling with blood. For this reason, blood pressure is expressed as two numbers called systolic pressure and diastolic pressure (e.g., 120/80). Systolic blood pressure (the top number of the fraction) is the pressure in the arteries during systole (i.e., when the ventricles are contracting and causing the ejection of blood into the aorta and pulmonary arteries)",

When applying the cuff to the client’s arm, the end of the cuff should be within the indicated range margins on the cuff. See Figure 7.10 [22] for an image of the range designated on the cuff. After the cuff is in place, press the start button on the monitor. The cuff will automatically inflate to a specific pressure and then deflate at a rate of 2 mmHg per second.

Oxygen saturation , also referred to as SpO2, is a client’s oxygenation status measured by a pulse oximeter. SpO2 estimates a person’s oxygenation level based on how much hemoglobin in their red blood cells is “saturated” with oxygen. The target range of SpO2 for an adult is 94-98%. For patients with chronic respiratory conditions, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), their normal range for SpO2 is often lower (e.g., 88% to 92%).

For example, severe anemia (i.e., decreased level of hemoglobin in the blood) or decreased peripheral circulation can cause an inaccurately low SpO2 level. [24] A pulse oximeter includes a sensor that measures light absorption of hemoglobin to estimate oxygen saturation. See Figure 7.12 [25] for an image of a pulse oximeter. The sensor can be attached to the patient using a variety of devices. For intermittent measurement of oxygen saturation, a spring-loaded clip is attached to a patient’s finger or toe. However, this clip is too large for use on newborns and young children, so the sensor is typically taped to a finger or toe. An earlobe clip is an alternative for patients who cannot tolerate the finger or toe clip or have a condition (such as vasoconstriction and poor peripheral perfusion) that can affect the results",

If a resident is nonambulatory, the nursing assistant should weigh the wheelchair and any associated accessories (such as foot pedals or a chair cushion). After the resident is dressed and groomed, the nursing assistant should bring them to the scale, obtain the weight, and then subtract the weight of the chair and associated accessories. See Figure 7.13 [1] for an image of weighing a resident on a wheelchair scale. If a resident requires transfer with a full-body mechanical lift, some lifts have a scale function that can weigh the resident as they transfer from bed to wheelchair. Resident height is typically obtained on admission and documented in the medical record. Because height rarely changes, measurement is rarely repeated.

Figure 7.14 [2] shows a person being measured with a stadiometer. If a resident is nonambulatory or unable to stand, their height can be measured with a tape measure while they are lying in bed. Height is recorded in inches or millimeters based on agency policy. Nursing assistants may be asked to obtain a height and weight to calculate a resident’s Body Mass Index (BMI). Body mass index (BMI) is a calculated measure of body fat based on a person’s height and weight. It is calculated by dividing weight in kilograms by the square of their height in meters. BMI is used to evaluate if an individual is underweight (BMI less than 18.5), normal (BMI 18.6-24.9), overweight (BMI over 25), or obese (BMI over 30). Elevated BMI measurements are associated with cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and other chronic diseases. [3]",

Therefore, urine is the most commonly measured output. Other fluids, like wound drainage in a drainage device, are also measured. Fluids are typically documented as milliliters (mL). See the Chapter 5.7, “ Documentation of Food and Fluids ” subsection for review of converting ounces to mL and additional information on measuring intake and output.

Due to the effects of aging on the integumentary system, older adults can develop pressure injuries from friction and shear when repositioned or from lying in one position for long periods of time in bed. Pressure injuries (formerly called pressure ulcers or bedsores) are localized damage to the skin or underlying soft tissue, usually over a bony prominence, as a result of intense and prolonged pressure and/or shear. [1] Shear happens when skin moves one way but the underlying bone and muscle stay fixed or move the opposite direction. Shear can occur when an individual sits up in a bed, chair, or wheelchair, and gravity causes the bone and muscle to slide down while the skin is pulled in the opposite direction by the sheets or clothing. Friction is caused when skin is rubbed by clothing, linens, or another body part and can cause chafing",

[2] For additional information on friction and shear, visit the Wound Care Education Institute’s Friction vs. Shearing in Wound Care web page . To prevent friction and shear, residents should be moved in bed with a lift sheet. The lift sheet , also called a draw sheet, is placed between the resident and the bottom or fitted sheet. (Review types of linens in “ Making an Unoccupied Bed Checklist ” in Chapter 3.) The lift sheet protects the client’s skin by creating a barrier when the client is moved so the friction that occurs happens between the lift sheet and fitted sheet rather than the resident’s skin and the fitted sheet",

Lift sheets should always be used to reposition a client who requires assistance, and failing to do so is considered neglectful due to the high probability of skin injury. See Figure 8.2 [3] for an image of boosting a resident in bed with a lift sheet. The steps for boosting a client up in bed include the following components [4] : Pressure injuries are preventable by repositioning clients at least every two hours and reporting any skin redness or other changes to the nurse for additional interventions.

Repositioning a client every hour should be documented, indicating the time and the positions the resident was moved from and placed into. An example of documentation is, “At 1400, the resident was repositioned from a right side-lying position to a supine position.” Similar to how nursing assistants use good body alignment (i.e., good posture) to prevent musculoskeletal injuries to themselves, the same principle should also be applied to residents.

For example, foam wedges are placed behind a patient’s back to prevent them from returning to the supine position or rolling close to the edge of the bed. See Figure 8.4 [6] for images of a wedge cushion and a client positioned using a wedge cushion.

Safety is an integral component of moving clients and should receive the highest priority. Special consideration should be given to these items to prevent injury from occurring: Nursing assistants should always review a client’s care plan for their current transfer status before moving them. Transfer status refers to how a resident moves from one place to the other, such as from a bed to wheelchair or wheelchair to toilet. Physical therapists (i.e., health specialists who evaluate and treat movement disorders) assess clients and make recommendations for how clients should be safely transferred. Transfer status orders are determined by how much body weight a client can independently bear and how much weight an assistant is required to support",

Transfer status orders include these types of orders: When transferring a client using a 1A, 2A, or sit-to-stand transfer method, first assist the resident to move to a seated position on the side of their bed. Residents who can transfer with one of these methods are able to bear some or most of their weight and should be able to move partially on their own. Use your hands on the person’s limbs to direct the movement, and use the lift sheet (similar to when boosting a client up in bed). Due to heart and circulation changes that occur with age, orthostatic hypotension can occur when a person moves suddenly from a lying to sitting position or from a sitting to standing position. Orthostatic hypotension is a sudden drop in blood pressure that can cause clients to feel dizzy and increase their risk for falls with position changes. Some clients may experience vertigo , a sensation that the room is spinning",

Dangling gives the cardiovascular system time to regulate blood pressure and blood flow to the brain, thus preventing dizziness and falls. Ask the client if they are feeling dizzy before you proceed with transferring.

After the person is sitting upright and states they are not experiencing dizziness, apply a gait belt for a 1A or 2A transfer. The gait belt should be placed around their waist while considering the location of their breasts and abdominal folds. See Figure 8.12 [3] for an image of applying a gait belt.

When transferring a client from their bed to wheelchair using a sit-to-stand or portable full-body mechanical lift, the wheelchair should be positioned near the bed while also allowing enough room for the lift to rotate towards the chair. Because the lift will have to slide underneath the bed, check for any cords or equipment under the bed that can cause the lift to get tangled.

If the resident loses their balance while in this position, the NA’s arm will allow them to use their bicep muscle, rather than their forearm, to steady the client. The bicep is larger and stronger than the forearm and can provide better support. A second staff member can follow a resident who is ambulating with assistance with their wheelchair in case they experience weakness or dizziness. If the client needs to sit while ambulating, the wheelchair brakes should be applied before they sit, or in an emergent situation, the NA should block the back of the wheelchair with their body to ensure stability when the resident sits. If a resident starts to fall while standing or ambulating, do not attempt to stop their fall or catch the resident because this can cause you to injure your back. Instead, move behind the patient and take one step back with one leg so you have a wide base of support",

It is important to note that the definition states the medication “is not standard treatment or dosage for the patient’s condition.” Seclusion is defined as the confinement of a patient in a locked room from which they cannot exit on their own.

A restrained person has a natural tendency to struggle and try to remove the restraint and can fall or become fatally entangled in the restraint. Furthermore, immobility that results from the use of restraints can cause pressure injuries, contractures, and muscle loss. Restraints take a large emotional toll on the patient’s self-esteem and may cause humiliation, fear, and anger.

The ANA also states that restraints may be justified in some patients with severe dementia or delirium when they are at risk for serious injuries such as a hip fracture due to falling.

Here are some examples of how common devices can be considered a restraint: There are many interventions available to keep residents safe without applying restraints. When a potentially unsafe behavior is occurring, the health care team should look at all the factors surrounding the behavior to determine the root cause. After the root cause is determined, the staff can implement appropriate redirection. Common risks and appropriate interventions include the following: If a resident continues to attempt to self-transfer without assistance: If a resident is agitated or aggressive towards other residents: If a resident wanders or wants to leave the facility: Motion sensors, pressure or tab alarms, and wanderguards are all alarms. There are many facilities that choose not to use alarms because they can be disruptive to the environment due to the noise and can reduce the dignity of the resident",

Rehabilitation may begin in an acute care setting when intensive interventions are required several times throughout the day and then transfer to a short-term stay or rehabilitation unit in a long-term care facility for further rehabilitation. In the long-term care facility, they typically see therapists once or twice a day until they are independent enough to return to their previous home environment. Both of these situations are referred to as in-patient therapy because the rehabilitation treatment occurs in a facility where the client is staying. However, in some cases, the individual can return home and visit a therapist once or twice a week, which is referred to as out-patient therapy. Out-patient therapy is commonly prescribed for post-operative rehabilitation, such as that required for a hip, knee, or shoulder replacement",

Therapists determine the types of interventions needed and the frequency of treatments based on each individual’s situation. Therapists provide rehabilitation treatment for as long as the client continues to improve, but it will conclude when their progress plateaus (i.e., their level of function remains the same and no longer improves). Sometimes an individual is unable to achieve their prior level of functioning and must remain in a long-term care facility for assistance and supportive care for the remainder of their life. When this occurs, the individual will have a restorative care plan that is further discussed in the “ Rehabilitation Versus Restorative Care ” section of this chapter.",

Risks of immobility are well-known, and complications are viewed as avoidable. In fact, many insurance companies do not reimburse health care agencies for complications resulting from immobility, like pressure injuries, because they are viewed as avoidable with the proper care.

Sometimes a client’s lack of endurance in completing activities requires the nursing assistant to segment their ADLs. Segmenting ADLs refers to breaking up tasks to accommodate the client’s activity intolerance. An example of segmenting ADLs would be assisting a person to bathe in bed as independently as possible, letting them rest after bathing, and then returning later to assist them with dressing and grooming to get them ready for the day",

Because changes in joints can occur after just three days of immobility, ROM exercises should be started by the nursing assistant as soon as they are directed by the nurse as safe to do so. There are three types of ROM exercises: passive, active, and active assist. Passive range of motion is movement applied to an individual’s joint by another person or by a passive motion machine.

We use this action every day when we step to the side, get out of bed, and get out of the car. Adduction refers to moving a limb towards the midline. For example, if a person has their fingers spread wide apart, bringing them back together is adduction. Flexion is movement that decreases the angle between two bones and extension is movement that increases the angle between two bones. For example, a bicep curl during weight lifting demonstrates both flexion and extension. Flexion occurs when the bicep muscle contracts and the elbow joint bends, lifting the weight. Extension occurs when the arm is straightened back to starting position, increasing the angle between the elbow joint",

The plan is tailored to the needs of the individual and will include the specific joints to move. Typically, larger joints such as shoulders, elbows, hips, knees, and ankles are included in ROM exercises, but ROM can be also applied to smaller joints such as the fingers and wrists. When assisting with ROM exercises, the nursing assistant must support any joints below the joint being exercised to prevent injury. For instance, if the shoulder is being exercised, the nursing assistant places their hands underneath the elbow and wrist to support them.

For example, a client who has had limited mobility for several years may have a joint that can only be moved a few inches, but it is important to maintain that mobility, no matter how small. While providing ROM, the nursing assistant must observe for objective and subjective signs of pain. The resident should be asked if they are experiencing any pain during the movement, and the assistant should watch for nonverbal signs of pain like grimacing, clenching the teeth, groaning, or labored breathing. Refer to the “ Objective and Subjective Signs of Pain ” subsection in Chapter 6.3 to review observations to make and report.

Decreased lung function can reduce a person’s stamina and their ability to perform activities, referred to as activity intolerance . To prevent a decrease in lung function, reduce the build-up of fluids in the airways, and prevent pneumonia, clients are often prescribed incentive spirometry to keep their bronchioles open. The incentive spirometer encourages a client to complete slow, deep breathing to keep their bronchioles open. See Figure 9.4 [4] for an image of a client using an incentive spirometer. Nursing assistants are often expected to encourage clients to use their incentive spirometer hourly. The nurse or respiratory therapist initially teaches the client how to use the incentive spirometer but encouraging and observing clients complete this action every hour is commonly delegated to a nursing assistant",

When blood is not moving much due to client inactivity, it can coagulate (i.e, form a clot). This blockage reduces blood flow to the affected area. A deep-vein thrombosis (DVT) is a blood clot that forms within the deep veins, usually of the lower leg, but can occur anywhere within the cardiovascular system. If the clot breaks free, it can travel to the lungs and become fatal. The best way for nursing assistants to prevent DVT is to assist clients to ambulate or otherwise complete as much activity as they can tolerate. Some clients are prescribed compression stockings , also referred to as thrombo-embolic-deterrent hose (TED hose). Compression stockings promote the return of fluid back into circulation by gently providing pressure on veins. They are commonly used for clients with swelling of their extremities ( edema ) caused by cardiac conditions that cause fluid retention",

Compression stockings require a physician’s order and should be applied in the morning and taken off at night. They should be applied upon awakening because edema is usually at its lowest point after lying in bed overnight. However, as the client sits or stands upright during the day, blood tends to pool in the lower legs. The pressure from compression stockings helps return fluid into the cardiovascular system and may reduce the risk for DVT. When removed at night, the compression stockings should be washed by hand in the sink with soap and water and then hung to air dry. Do not send them to the laundry or put them on a heater to dry because this can cause shrinking and ruin the hose.

For example, some compression stockings may seem like slightly tight socks, whereas other stockings for clients with severe edema are custom-made to fit very tightly and may have a zipper for ease of application. When applying stockings, proper placement on the heel is important. The stockings have a square marker around the heel to guide correct placement on the heel.

Always encourage clients to complete as many ADLs as they can, segmenting them if needed. When you notice a client is becoming fatigued or irritable when performing a task, it is often a good time to begin assisting the client. It does not matter how little a person is able to do for themselves; they should be given the time and opportunity to do so. For nonverbal clients, consider using a white board, communication book, or other device to assist in their communication. These actions demonstrate respect for the person’s dignity, as well as promote their physical health and cognitive involvement in their own care.

The most common form of hearing loss occurs as a natural part of aging and is called presbycusis . This type of hearing loss is typically worse at higher frequency sounds, so it interferes with speech recognition and music appreciation. Men tend to experience greater hearing loss than females, perhaps because they have historically worked in louder environments, but it is unknown how much the differences in hearing between genders are caused by biological or social factors. [8] Hearing can impact an individual’s safety risks. For example, the sense of hearing allows a person to locate objects around them making noise without much conscious thought. For example, sounds like fire alarms or ambulance sirens warn people of emergencies.

Stand directly in front of the person when you are speaking, use appropriate gestures to guide actions, and use a light touch to gain their attention or assist in movement. People with hearing loss may become frustrated if they are unable to communicate effectively and may withdraw from interaction with others if hearing loss is profound.

Some hearing aids have rechargeable batteries that should be charged each night while the resident sleeps. See Figure 9.16 [9] for a hearing aid in a case with a battery and a cleaning tool. Hearing aids are expensive for residents to purchase, so it is important to always handle them with care and store them in an appropriate place, so they are not lost.

The feeling of being rushed can make aphasia worse, so providing ample time to process and respond is key. Writing conversations on a whiteboard may also be helpful, depending upon the cognition of the person. A speech therapist plays an integral role in assessing a resident with aphasia and creating a communication plan.

Each year, three million older people are treated in emergency departments for fall injuries, and over 800,000 are hospitalized because of a head injury or hip fracture resulting from a fall. Many older adults who fall, even if they’re not injured, become afraid of falling. This fear may cause them to limit their everyday activities. When a person is less active, they become weaker, which further increases their chances of falling. [1] Many conditions increase an individual’s risk for falls, including the following [2] : Most falls are caused by a combination of risk factors.

Nursing assistants do not perform this assessment but should be aware of factors that can increase fall risk. View a PDF sample of a fall risk assessment: Johns Hopkins Fall Risk Assessment Tool.",

As a health care professional, it is important to understand how you can continue to improve the quality of life in individuals with these diagnoses through your communication, awareness, and approach.

Often, residents slept in large rooms with several beds in close proximity to each other with no accommodations for privacy or noise reduction. This care environment often caused overstimulation, resulting in sleep disturbances and client behaviors that were difficult to manage. In contrast to current health care practices, individual preferences were not prioritized. These institutions lacked funding, professional caregivers, and basic knowledge of what residents needed to successfully function to the best of their ability. Because of these conditions, individuals with developmental or behavioral health disorders were often looked down upon, shunned, stigmatized, vilified, criminalized, and, in some cases, imprisoned or tortured",

[2] In the United States, this type of care environment continued until 1963 when President John F. Kennedy signed the Community Mental Health Act (as seen in Figure 10.2 [3] ). President Kennedy described this act as “a bold new approach” and provided federal grants to states to construct community mental health centers (CMHC). This act aimed to improve the diagnosis, treatment, and delivery of mental health services to individuals and prevent acute episodes that could impact their safety. In 1965 federal funding was allocated by the Medicaid Act to statewide institutions to improve conditions, staff education, and treatment of residents. [4] The Community Mental Health Act resulted in a mass “deinstitutionalization” across the country, and by 1980 the population of psychiatric hospitals had decreased by nearly 75%",

Deinstitutionalization meant that individuals with behavioral and developmental disorders were cared for in group home settings that allowed for community involvement rather than being isolated in a facility with little or no interaction with general society. By 2009 less than 2% of individuals with mental health disorders lived in a large institution, thus greatly increasing their quality of life, attention to their individualized needs and preferences, and their ability to be active in the community. [5] Additional consideration has also been given to school-aged children and adolescents with developmental disorders and disabilities to be educated in a mainstream environment. In 1975 the Education of Handicapped Children Act was passed to support special education and related service programming for children and youth with disabilities in public schools. This act mandated that everyone with an intellectual disability was granted equal access to a free education",

These impairments result from problems that occurred during fetal development or injuries sustained during birth or early infancy, such as cerebral palsy and autism. Other disorders, such as Down syndrome, have a genetic cause. [1] These impairments can impact mobility, problem-solving, planning, abstract thinking, judgment, academic learning, and learning from experience. Individuals with developmental disorders often function at a lower developmental stage than the average person of the same chronological age. [2] Intellectual disabilities are diagnosed by health care providers based on two major criteria [3] : Intellectual functioning is typically measured by a standardized IQ test. The average score of an IQ test is 100. People scoring below 70 to 75 are thought to have an intellectual disability",

Skills important for adaptive behavior include the following [4] : Adaptive behavior is much more about how a person manages in daily life and their ability to do the things that are expected of their age within their culture. Without ongoing support, deficits in adaptive behavior limit an individual’s functioning in many areas such as communication, social participation, and independent living at home, school, work, or in the community.

[11] Common physical features of individuals with Down syndrome include the following [12] : Most people with Down syndrome have common facial features but no other major birth defects. However, some people with Down syndrome have other major birth defects and an increased risk of medical problems such as heart or thyroid disease.

Abnormal deposits of proteins occur throughout the brain and form structures called amyloid plaques and tau tangles, causing previously healthy nerve cells (neurons) to stop functioning, lose connections with other neurons, and die. The damage initially appears to take place in the hippocampus and the cortex, the parts of the brain that are essential for forming memories. As additional neurons die, more parts of the brain are affected and begin to shrink. By the final stage of AD, damage is widespread, and brain tissue has shrunk significantly. [4] See Figure 10.6 [5] for images comparing a healthy brain to the changes that occur during AD. There is no single diagnostic test that can determine if a person has AD. Health care providers use a patient’s medical history, mental status tests, physical and neurological exams, and diagnostic tests to diagnose AD and other types of dementia",

This means the person can understand instructions and has the ability to complete an action but cannot process the cue to actually perform the task. Agnosia is the failure to recognize or identify objects despite intact sensory function. [7] Lewy body dementia (LBD) affects approximately 10 to 20% of patients with dementia. Like Alzheimer’s disease, LBD causes a progressive decline in cognition, leading to a functional impairment in daily activities. This type of dementia typically appears around age 70, and Parkinson’s disease and sleep disorders are often precursors to being diagnosed with LBD. Significant features of LBD are fluctuating cognition, visual hallucinations, and sleep disturbances that affect motor and psychiatric functioning. These factors increase the risk of falls, infection, and malnutrition",

[8] Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is caused by degeneration of neurons in the frontal and anterior temporal lobes of the brain. In patients older than 65 years, it is the third most common cause of dementia. For individuals younger than 65 years, it is the second most common cause of early-onset dementia and commonly affects patients ranging from 45 to 65 years of age.

Without the ability to communicate these needs, the individual may display agitation, aggression, shouting, combativeness, and many other behaviors that can be distressing for all involved. The patient’s family members and caregivers require education and support to recognize that behaviors are a symptom of dementia and/or a communication of their needs rather than being upset with the caregiver.

They may try to reorient the person to the present time and situation, which can be frustrating for a person with dementia because they are unable to process these cues. One of the most effective methods used to assist people with dementia is called validation therapy, meaning you support the reality the person with dementia is experiencing and do not attempt to reorient them. Begin by determining what the person is perseverating on and figure out a way to satisfy their need or respond to their emotion. For example, if a person with dementia is perseverating on the need to catch an imagined bus, you can sit with them by a window and tell them you will have a conversation until the bus arrives",

Remember that individuals with dementia still retain long-term memories, and these memories often provide comfort and ease anxiety. It is helpful to provide activities similar to those they formerly enjoyed or simulate situations that resemble their prior work or home environment. For example, if a person was a homemaker, allow them to fold laundry or towels. If they enjoyed working with their hands, provide nuts and bolts to put together and take apart.

There are several actions a nursing assistant can take to promote food intake. If the patient has difficulty with the motor skills of eating or drinking, determine if sensory deficits may be the issue. If the dining area is noisy, try moving them to a quieter area where it may be easier to hear prompts. Bringing the person near the area where food is prepared can increase their appetite by smelling the aromas of the meal. After the food is served, position the food in the client’s direct line of vision. Put a small amount of food on a spoon and hold it gently to the lips, allowing ample time for them to process the feeling and open their mouth. Multitextured foods like cereal in milk can contribute to confusion over whether to chew or swallow. It may take a long time for the person to swallow, or they may have difficulty swallowing",

Remind the person to tuck their chin towards their chest to reduce aspiration risk and aid in swallowing. If the person is holding the food in their mouth, gently rub their neck over their throat because this often prompts them to swallow. People with dementia and some with developmental disabilities may “ pocket ” their food, meaning they keep it in their cheeks and don’t swallow it. You may have to use an oral swab after meals to be certain that there is no food left in their mouth. It can be difficult to tell when a person is full if they have dementia or other communication deficits. When they stop taking in food during a meal and seem full, a good practice is to hold each type of food to their lips one more time to be sure they have had all they want to eat of each food choice.

If the person with Alzheimer’s or other dementia prefers a communal living environment or requires more care than can be safely provided at home, a residential facility such as assisted living or long-term care may be the best option for meeting the individual’s needs. Different types of facilities provide different levels of care, depending on the person’s needs. [5] These varying levels were presented in the Chapter 2.6, “ Health Care Settings ” section. Caregiver role strain can also occur when health care providers feel overwhelmed or unable to appropriately provide the care needed to manage the complex holistic needs of patients dependent upon them for their care.

Although this is the foundation of being a competent and dependable caregiver, providing care when you are not at your best can be unsafe for both you and those you care for. Feelings of stress overload related to client care should be communicated with your supervisor. Working while experiencing these feelings can result in poor decision-making and possibly result in negligence in your care. Here are some things to do to help manage your work responsibilities and stay healthy: Just as you would report a change in behavior for a resident, you should treat yourself in the same manner. Knowing when you need a break or additional assistance is a responsible and professional action.

The transportation of nutrients begins in the small intestine where they are absorbed and then transported to the liver through the hepatic portal vein. From the liver, nutrients travel in the blood up to the inferior vena cava blood vessel to the heart. The heart pumps the nutrient-rich blood to the lungs to pick up oxygen.

This reduced diameter of capillaries slows the speed of blood flow and gives cells time to harvest the nutrients and oxygen in the blood and return metabolic wastes to the capillary to be eliminated. Deoxygenated blood containing metabolic wastes is transported back to the heart via veins, and wastes are filtered out by the kidneys and liver. [4] As the body ages, the strength and elasticity of the heart and blood vessels decrease, resulting in a decreased ability to regulate blood pressure, distribute oxygen, and remove wastes from the body.

Ingestion may seem a simple process, but it includes smelling food as it is prepared and served, thinking about food and making food choices, and the involuntary release of saliva in the mouth to prepare for food entry. After food enters the mouth, the next steps of mechanical and chemical digestion of food begin. Mechanical digestion starts with chewing when teeth crush and grind large food particles into smaller pieces that are easy to swallow. Chemical digestion of food involves enzymes found in saliva that break down particles into smaller components. [1] In the mouth, saliva provides lubrication and enables food to move downward through the esophagus (a muscular tube that goes from the mouth to the stomach).

As the bolus is swallowed, it is pushed from the mouth through the pharynx (i.e., throat) and into the esophagus. As the bolus travels through the pharynx, a small flap called the epiglottis closes to keep food from going into the trachea and down into the lungs. Peristaltic contractions in the esophagus (referred to as peristalsis ) propel the bolus down to the stomach.

The condition of one’s teeth (referred to as dentition ) often declines during the aging process, resulting in the decreased ability to chew foods with a dense or tough consistency (such as meat and fibrous vegetables).

Absorption of nutrients in the small intestine is less efficient, which can cause malnutrition even though food intake may be sufficient. Lastly, the slowing of peristalsis allows the bolus to remain in the large intestine for longer periods of time. As water continues to be absorbed, the fecal matter becomes drier and more difficult to expel, resulting in constipation and possible bowel obstruction. A bowel obstruction stops the bolus and other digestive contents from reaching the part of the intestine beyond the blockage. The lack of peristalsis that occurs during a bowel obstruction can cause the large intestine to twist upon itself, cutting off circulation and causing tissue death. The area of the intestine experiencing tissue death may require surgical removal. Sometimes the remaining parts of the healthy intestine can be reattached to regain normal bowel function",

The function of the pancreas is affected by a medical condition called diabetes. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that 11 percent of the U.S. population has diabetes, and 49 percent of adults over age 65 have prediabetes. [3] See maps of diabetes and obesity by county at CDC’s Diabetes and Obesity Maps web page. In type 1 diabetes, the pancreas becomes unable to make insulin. In type 2 diabetes, obesity causes changes in muscle, fat, and liver cells that leads to their diminished response to insulin, referred to as “insulin-resistance.” When cells are resistant to insulin, they do not take in enough glucose to make energy, resulting in high levels of glucose in the blood. Chronically elevated blood glucose damages other tissues over time, increasing the individual’s risk for cardiovascular disease, kidney disease, nerve damage, and eye disease",

Characteristics such as color and odor provide a rough estimate of a person’s state of hydration. For example, after exercising or working outside on a hot day and sweating heavily, urine will become darker with a slight odor.

[1] The main function of the central nervous system is to utilize the senses of sight, touch, hearing, taste, and smell to detect changes in the external environment and create a reaction to them. For instance, if your finger comes into contact with a thorn on a rose bush, a sensory neuron transmits a signal from your finger up through the spinal cord and into the brain. Another neuron in the brain sends a signal that travels back to the muscles in your hand and stimulates muscles to contract so that you jerk your finger away. All this happens within a tenth of a second. Nerves communicate with each other via chemicals built from amino acids called neurotransmitters . Eating adequate protein from a variety of sources will ensure the body gets all the different amino acids that are important for central nervous system function",

Although the reproductive system is essential to keeping a species alive, unlike other body systems, it’s not essential to keeping an individual alive. Because the endocrine system controls the hormone levels throughout the body, it has a large role in the functioning of the reproductive system. Hormone levels affect growth and development, appetite, mood, body temperature, and stress, along with sexual function and reproductive health. Both the male and female reproductive systems are necessary to reproduce. The organs that are part of both reproductive systems are referred to as genitals. [1] The external part of the female reproductive organs is called the vulva, which covers the opening to the vagina and other internal reproductive organs. Two pairs of skin flaps called the labia surround the vaginal opening",

The clitoris, a small sensory organ, is located toward the front of the vulva where the folds of the labia join. Between the labia are openings to the urethra and vagina. When girls become sexually mature, called puberty, the outer labia and the mons pubis are covered by pubic hair. A female’s internal reproductive organs are the vagina, uterus, Fallopian tubes, and ovaries. See Figure 11.16 [2] for an illustration of the organs of the female reproductive system. Toward the end of puberty, girls begin to release eggs as part of a monthly period called the menstrual cycle . About once a month, during ovulation, an ovary sends an egg into one of the Fallopian tubes. Unless the egg is fertilized by a male’s sperm while in the Fallopian tube, the egg leaves the body about two weeks later through the uterus in a process called menstruation",

[3] The menstrual cycle continues until menopause, when levels of estrogen decline and the woman no longer releases eggs. This usually occurs sometime around the late forties to early fifties. As estrogen levels decrease, women may experience irregular periods, hot flashes, night sweats, mood swings, and changes in metabolism. [4] The external male genitals are the penis and scrotum. The urethra runs from the bladder through the penis to expel urine externally. Internally, the male reproductive system includes the testes, the duct system made up of the epididymis and the vas deferens, and the accessory glands that include the seminal vesicles and prostate gland. Testosterone is a hormone that increases during puberty and is produced in the testes",

Testosterone is responsible for causing boys to develop deeper voices, larger muscles, and body and facial hair. It also stimulates the production of sperm that fertilizes the egg of a female. [5] See Figure 11.17 [6] for an illustration of the male reproductive system. All males are born with a foreskin, a fold of skin at the end of the penis. Some boys are circumcised, which means that a doctor or a clergy member cuts away the foreskin. Circumcision is typically performed during a baby’s first few days of life based on parental religious beliefs, concerns about hygiene, or cultural or social reasons. There is no medical necessity for circumcision. As men age, their prostate enlarges",

Because the prostate surrounds the urethra, its enlargement often causes urinary issues such as the decreased ability to dispel urine, frequent urination, an intermittent stream of urine, and retention of urine in the bladder. Urinary retention and incomplete emptying of urine from the bladder increase the male resident’s risk of urinary tract infections, so signs of infection should be monitored by nursing assistants.",
